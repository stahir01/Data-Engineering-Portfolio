## 6) Docker

- Docker is essential for developing and deploying applications efficiently.
- **Learning Resources**:
  - [Docker Basics Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw2Jrid4SaQ)
  - [Docker for Beginners Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE)
  - [Docker Project Practice Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnSH8Ht3MIc)

After familiarizing yourself with Docker, take the following steps to gain hands-on experience:

   - Create a new Docker project where you:
      - Build a Docker image for your application.
      - Create a Docker container from the image.
      - Deploy it using a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
      - Import the Docker container you deployed and make changes to your application.
      - Rebuild the Docker image and redeploy it using the CI/CD pipeline.
   
This practical project will provide you with a complete understanding of setting up Docker, building images, deploying containers, making changes, and updating your application seamlessly.
